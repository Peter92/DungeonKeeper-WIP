Slowly going to try build a game, I'll add various parts here as I work on them.

#Current features

Display an infinite world (currently empty)

Infinite player movement

Random noise on tiles, with optimisation

#Files

RPGCore.py: Currently only contains code for infinite movement

RPGWorld.py: Used to create the world, could be swapped out with procedural generation.
