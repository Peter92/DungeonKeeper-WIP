Slowly going to try build a game, I'll add various parts here as I work on them.

#Current features

Infinite camera movement (optimised)

Random noise on tiles (optimised)

Zooming dependant on cursor position

Drag to mark blocks for deletion

#Next up

Rewrite tiles to chunks since they're still slow

Add basic units to mine the selected blocks
